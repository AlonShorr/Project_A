# Lidar Pygame Simulator

A grid-based simulator for developing and testing a probabilistic localization and autonomous navigation system. The robot carries five ToF (Time-of-Flight) distance sensors and uses a Bayes filter to estimate its position on the map, then plans an optimal path to a goal using A*.

## Running the Simulator

```bash
cd lidar_sim/
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 lidar_pygame_sim.py
```

## Module Descriptions

### `config.py`
Single source of truth for every constant in the project. Nothing here is computed at runtime — change a value here and it propagates everywhere.

Key groups:
- **Display** — window size, grid size, pixel dimensions
- **Physics/Sensor** — cell size in mm, sensor range, noise level, sensor angles
- **Wall indices** — `WALL_UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT` (used throughout the codebase)
- **Algorithm thresholds** — localization confidence levels, step delays
- **Colors** — all pygame color tuples

### `sim_robot.py` — `Robot`
Represents the simulated robot. Owns its grid position, heading, and sensor state.

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `move_to(r, c)` | Teleport to a cell, update pixel coords |
| `move_rel(dr, dc, wall_map)` | Step one cell, blocked by walls. Returns `True` on success |
| `rotate(direction)` | +1 = clockwise, -1 = counter-clockwise (45° steps) |
| `toggle_sensor(idx)` | Enable/disable one of the 5 sensors |
| `measure(wall_map)` | Ray-cast all active sensors; returns distances in mm and hit points in pixels |

The `measure` method steps a ray along each sensor's absolute angle (robot heading + sensor offset), crossing cell boundaries until it hits a wall or reaches `MAX_RANGE_MM`. Distances are converted from pixels to mm and optionally perturbed with Gaussian noise to simulate the real VL53L4CD sensor.

### `map_builder.py`
Everything related to defining and editing the map.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `generate_wall_map()` | Builds the Alon House map as a `(Rows, Cols, 4)` NumPy array |
| `toggle_wall_click(wall_map, mx, my)` | Flips the wall edge nearest to a mouse click; syncs both sides of the shared edge |
| `dump_selected_cells(data, cells)` | Prints pre-computed sensor readings for selected cells to the console (debug) |

The wall map encodes each cell's four edges as `0 = wall` / `1 = open`. Every function that reads or writes walls uses the indices from `config.py` (`WALL_UP`, `WALL_DOWN`, `WALL_LEFT`, `WALL_RIGHT`).

### `localization.py`
Implements the probabilistic localization pipeline (histogram/Bayes filter).

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `precompute_all_orientations(wall_map)` | Ray-casts a virtual robot at every (cell, angle) and caches the results |
| `update_probability(prob, measured, expected, angle)` | **Correction step** — weights each cell by Gaussian likelihood of the measurements |
| `predict_motion(prob, dr, dc, wall_map)` | **Prediction step** — shifts the probability cloud then blurs it with a 3×3 kernel |
| `get_best_estimate(prob)` | Returns `(row, col, peak_probability)` of the most likely cell |
| `do_localization_step(robot, wall_map, spin, moves)` | Drives the spin-then-explore recovery sequence one frame at a time |

**Filter sigma:** The Gaussian likelihood uses `σ = 20 mm`. The real sensor is accurate to ±1 mm, but a cell is 180 mm wide. The larger sigma prevents the filter from collapsing when the robot is slightly off-center in a cell.

**Blur kernel:** The motion blur distributes 40% of each cell's mass to itself, 10% to each cardinal neighbor, and 5% to each diagonal neighbor, then re-normalizes. This prevents the filter from becoming overconfident after movement.

### `active_localization.py`
Replaces the old spin-then-random-walk recovery with an information-theoretic policy. When the robot is lost or its belief is multimodal, passive re-measurement cannot break the tie — every competing hypothesis predicts the same reading, so the belief stays stuck. Active localization deliberately picks the action whose *expected* observation differs most across the competing hypotheses, collapsing the belief as fast as possible.

**Theory.** The belief's uncertainty is measured by Shannon entropy (in nats):

```
H(Bel) = -sum_x Bel(x) * ln Bel(x)
```

A fully localized belief has H ≈ 0; k equiprobable cells give H = ln k. For each candidate action `a`, the policy:
1. Runs the motion model to get the predicted belief `Bel^-` (moves use `predict_motion`; rotations leave the belief unchanged).
2. For each of the top-K most probable hypotheses `x'`, looks up the noiseless sensor reading the robot would get if it were truly at `x'` (from `expected_data`), runs the Bayes correction, and measures the resulting entropy.
3. Averages those entropies weighted by `Bel^-(x')` to get `E[H | a]`.
4. Chooses `a* = argmax_a [ H(Bel) - E[H|a] - cost(a) ]`.

Costs are in nats so they trade off directly against information gain. Defaults are small, so during the lost phase information dominates.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `select_best_action(belief, expected_data, wall_map, heading)` | Scores all 11 candidate actions and returns the best one plus diagnostics |
| `apply_action_to_robot(robot, action, wall_map)` | Executes one frame of an action: one 45° turn toward the target heading, or the forward step once aligned. Returns `(dr, dc)` moved. |
| `belief_entropy(belief)` | Shannon entropy of a probability matrix, in nats |
| `information_gain(belief, action, ...)` | Expected entropy reduction for a single candidate action |

The pygame loop calls `select_best_action` once per completed action to pick the next one, and `apply_action_to_robot` every frame to execute it step by step.

### `motion_planning.py`
A thin wrapper that calls into `astar_planner.py` and returns a path in a format the simulator loop can directly consume.

```python
path = plan_path(start=(r, c, theta_idx), goal=(r, c), wall_map=wall_map)
# Returns [(r0,c0), (r1,c1), ...] from start to goal inclusive,
# or [] if no path was found.
```

### `astar_planner.py`
Standalone A* planner implementation. Has no dependency on pygame or the simulator state.

**Key design rule:** the planner outputs *waypoint positions* (`result["path"]`), not movement commands. The simulator's navigation loop is responsible for turning the robot toward each waypoint and stepping forward.

The planner searches over `(r, c, theta_idx)` states. Action costs are 1.0 for a forward move, 0.25 for a 45° turn, and 0.5 for a 180° turn. The heuristic is Manhattan distance, which is admissible since every forward step costs ≥ 1.0. This guarantees the returned path is cost-optimal.

Key functions:

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `plan_astar(wall_map, start, goal, ...)` | Main entry point — returns a result dict with `"path"`, `"path_with_theta"`, and `"debug"` |
| `path_cells_to_world(path)` | Converts `[(r,c), ...]` to physical `[(x_m, y_m), ...]` coordinates (re-exported from `rrt_planner`) |

### `rrt_planner.py`
Grid utility library shared by the planner and other modules. Has no dependency on pygame.

Key functions:

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `bfs_shortest_path_cells(wall_map, start, goal)` | BFS shortest path between two cells; used for reachability checks |
| `validate_path(wall_map, start, goal, path)` | Checks that every step in a path is adjacent and wall-free |
| `can_move_forward(wall_map, state)` | Returns whether a forward step from `(r, c, theta)` is unblocked |
| `choose_localization_improving_waypoint(belief, wall_map, pos)` | Suggests a nearby cell with a distinctive wall signature to improve localization |

### `lidar_pygame_sim.py`
Entry point. Contains `main()` and nothing else — all logic lives in the modules above.

Responsibilities:
- Initialize pygame, fonts, and display
- Run the event loop (keyboard, mouse)
- Dispatch to `select_best_action`, `apply_action_to_robot`, `plan_path`, `predict_motion`, `update_probability` at the right times
- Manage the auto-mode state machine (`IDLE → LOCALIZING → PLANNING → MOVING → DONE`)
- Draw the map, probability heatmap, robot, sensor rays, planned path, and sidebar

Supporting data structures:
  wall_map      (Rows, Cols, 4)  numpy int array — the map
  expected_data (Rows, Cols, 8, 5) numpy float array — precomputed sensor readings
  prob_matrix   (Rows, Cols)     numpy float array — localization belief
```

---

## Map Format

The map is a NumPy array of shape `(Rows, Cols, 4)`.

- `wall_map[r, c, WALL_UP]` — top edge of cell `(r, c)`
- `wall_map[r, c, WALL_DOWN]` — bottom edge
- `wall_map[r, c, WALL_LEFT]` — left edge
- `wall_map[r, c, WALL_RIGHT]` — right edge

`0 = wall present`, `1 = passage open`.

Every wall is stored on both sides of the shared edge (e.g., the right wall of `(r, c)` equals the left wall of `(r, c+1)`). `map_builder.py` keeps these in sync.

## Heading Convention

Angle index `0` points East; indices increase clockwise at 45° steps.

| Index | Direction |
|---|---|
| 0 | East |
| 1 | South-East |
| 2 | South |
| 3 | South-West |
| 4 | West |
| 5 | North-West |
| 6 | North |
| 7 | North-East |

The A* planner only moves on cardinal headings (0, 2, 4, 6). Diagonal headings are used only for rotation.
